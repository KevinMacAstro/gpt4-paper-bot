As galaxies form\nand evolve inside dark matter haloes and the halo population canbe readily predicted by a given cosmology model (e.g. through\ncosmological N-body simulations), models based on the galaxy\u2013\nhalo connection have become the convenient and natural route tointerpret galaxy clustering data.\nThe commonly adopted descriptions of galaxy\u2013halo relation (see", "Wechsler & Tinker 2018 for a review), such as the framework of\nhalo occupation distribution (HOD; e.g. Berlind et al. 2003 )a n d\nconditional luminosity function (CLF; e.g. Yang, Mo & van den\nBosch 2003 ), have been successfully applied to galaxy surveys to\ninfer the relation between galaxy properties and halo mass (e.g. van\nden Bosch, Mo & Yang 2003 ; Zheng 2004 ;Z e h a v ie ta l . 2005 ,\n2011 ;G u oe ta l . 2014 ;X ue ta l . 2018 ). With such modelling, the", "high precision clustering measurements at small to intermediate\nscales (i.e. sub-Mpc to tens of Mpc) have the potential to tightencosmological constraints (e.g. Abazajian et al. 2005 ; Zheng &\n\u22c6E-mail: kevmac@caltech.edu (KSM); zhengzheng@astro.utah.edu (ZZ)Weinberg 2007 ; van den Bosch et al. 2013 ;R e i de ta l . 2014 ;Z h a i\net al. 2019 ).\nThe implicit assumption in the above frameworks is that the\nstatistical properties of galaxies inside haloes only depend on", "halo mass, not on halo environment or halo growth history, partly\nmotivated by the excursion set theory (Bond et al. 1991 ). However,\nit was later discovered, through N-body simulations (e.g. Sheth &\nTormen 2004 ; Gao, Springel & White 2005 ) and theoretical study\nof the statistics of the peaks of Gaussian random \ufb02uctuations (e.g.Dalal et al. 2008 ), that the clustering of haloes depends on not\nonly halo mass but also halo assembly history, which is termed", "halo assembly bias and has been under active investigations (e.g.Paranjape, Hahn & Sheth 2018 ;X u&Z h e n g 2018 ; Han et al.\n2019 ). If in haloes of \ufb01xed mass galaxy properties and halo\nassembly history are closely connected, the inherited assembly\nbias from the host haloes would be manifested as effects on\ngalaxy clustering. While such galaxy assembly bias, which canbe conceptually de\ufb01ned as dependence of galaxy clustering on\ngalaxy properties at \ufb01xed halo mass, could enable us to learn more", "about galaxy formation and evolution, it may introduce possiblesystematics in cosmological constraints (e.g. Zentner, Hearin &\nvan den Bosch 2014 ) or limit the range of clustering data to be\nused (e.g. McCarthy, Zheng & Guo 2019 ) if not properly accounted\nfor.\nC/circlecopyrt2021 The Author(s)\nPublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical SocietyDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/509/1/380/6369359 by guest on 11 May 2025", "Galaxy assembly bias in velocity space 381\nAn empirical detection of galaxy assembly bias effect will advance\nour understanding on galaxy formation and also guide the modeldevelopment for cosmological constraints with galaxy clustering.\nNo de\ufb01nite conclusion has been reached in the search of galaxy\nassembly bias effect in galaxy survey data.

The reported strong assembly bias effect in the\nprojected 2PCFs of massive clusters (Miyatake et al. 2016 ) appears\nto be an artefact caused by an insuf\ufb01cient control of projection effects(Zu et al. 2017 ).

( 2021 ) claim the detection of galaxy assembly\nbias in redshift-space clustering of BOSS CMASS galaxies, it is in\ncontradiction to the result in Guo et al. ( 2015a ).", "One major dif\ufb01culty in searching for assembly bias effect in\nobservational data lies in the halo mass determination, so that as-sembly bias effect can be well separated from the effect of clustering\nfrom the halo-mass dependence. In such regard, the assembly bias\nanalysis in Lin et al. ( 2016 , hereafter L16) is distinct. They construct\nsamples of central galaxies in SDSS in haloes of similar mass, and\nthe halo mass is veri\ufb01ed by galaxy lensing measurements. Their", "analysis with the projected 2PCFs of central galaxy samples withdifferent galaxy growth history and star formation properties shows\nno signi\ufb01cant evidence for assembly bias, which suggests that the\ncorrelation, if any, between the chosen galaxy assembly indicatorand halo formation history may not be tight (Xu & Zheng 2020 ).\nTheL16 analysis focuses on projected 2PCFs, effectively galaxy", "clustering in real space. In this work, we extend the clustering anal-ysis in L16 to redshift space with an extended sample construction.\nModelling of luminosity-threshold samples of galaxies in BOSS\nand SDSS has revealed the existence of velocity bias (Guo et al.2015a ,b), which is the difference between the motion of galaxies\nand dark matter particles inside haloes. In particular, the central", "galaxies do not appear to be at rest with respect to the host haloes(e.g. in the halo centre-of-mass frame), moving with a mean velocity\nabout 20\u201330 per cent of the velocity dispersion of dark matter inside\nhaloes, which re\ufb02ects the mutual relaxation of galaxies and haloes(Ye et al. 2017 ). Motivated by the expectation that central galaxies\nof different assembly/formation histories may have different degrees", "of relaxation with respect to host haloes, we perform investigationsof the redshift-space clustering with the extended L16 samples to\nsee whether such a difference exists or whether there is any hint for\nassembly bias in velocity space.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the\ndetails of the construction of the various galaxy samples, extending\nthose in L16. In Section 3, we describe the clustering measurements", "and the modelling method. The results are presented in Section 4,\nfollowed by a discussion in Section 5. Finally in Section 6, wesummarize the work and give the conclusion.\n2D A T A\nFor studying galaxy assembly bias, we would like to have samples of\ncentral galaxies in haloes of \ufb01xed mass to investigate the dependence\nof clustering on galaxy properties. L16 devise a procedure to", "construct early-forming and late-forming galaxy samples to havesimilar mean host halo mass of central galaxies, which is veri\ufb01ed\nwith galaxy lensing measurements. For simplicity, in this work theearly-forming (late-forming) galaxies are referred to as the early\n(late) galaxies.\nThis work will entail an extended analysis of the early/late galaxy\nsamples in L16. The galaxies in these samples are supposed to be\ncentral galaxies, selected base on the group catalogue of Yang et al.", "(2007 ,Y07) constructed from SDSS (York et al. 2000\n) Data Release\n7 (DR7; Abazajian et al. 2009 ), speci\ufb01cally from DR7 modelC.1We\nuse \u2018LIN\u2019 to label the original catalogue used in L16.\nL16 applied a satellite decontamination algorithm to remove the\nincorrectly labelled central galaxies from Y07. As will be shown\nin Section 4.1, this algorithm also removes a fraction of central", "galaxies, when they become close in the direction transverse tothe line of sight. It causes a paucity of signal at small scales for\nthe projected 2PCF. While this has no effect on the L16 results\nbased on large-scale projected clustering, it would affect our analysisof redshift-space clustering. Therefore, we also have samples of\ngalaxies selected with the same criteria as in L16 but without the\nsatellite decontamination algorithm. These samples are labelled as", "\u2018PCAT\u2019, for parent catalogues. The satellite component will be\naccounted for in our model.\nFinally, to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the clustering\nmeasurements and hence improve the model constraints, we also\nconstruct galaxy catalogues by loosening the selection criteria, whichextend the halo mass range to include more galaxies. We use \u2018EXT\u2019\nto denote these extended samples.\nIn what follows, we describe the selection of the galaxy samples", "and the division into the early and late galaxy samples according to\nstar formation history (SFH) and speci\ufb01c star formation rate (sSFR).\nThe galaxy counts and number density of each galaxy sample aresummarized in Table 1.\n2.1 SFH-based construction\nWe \ufb01rst describe how to form early/late galaxy samples with the\nSFH information of galaxies.

That is, in the halo rest frame early\ncentral galaxies would on average move at a velocity of the order of\n35\u201370 per cent that of the halo virial velocity. The stellar mass to halo\nmass ratio of these central galaxies is around 1 per cent (Section 2),", "and in the theoretical investigation of Ye et al. ( 2017 ), the expected\nvelocity bias is about 0.32 (see their \ufb01g. 2). Could this high velocitybias result from mistaking satellites as central galaxies? First, we\naccount for satellite galaxies in the model, and we \ufb01nd similar\ncentral velocity bias constraints with different parametrizations ofthe mean satellite occupation function. Secondly, given the selection\ncriteria, galaxies in the samples are dominated by central galaxies", "in haloes around 10\n12h\u22121M\u2299and their stellar mass is a few times\n1010h\u22122M\u2299(Section 2). It would be rare for such haloes to host\nsuch massive satellites. Such satellites can reside in more massive\nhaloes, but given the low satellite fraction they would not play a rolein signi\ufb01cantly interfering with the central velocity bias constraints.\nTherefore, the apparent high velocity bias inferred for early central\ngalaxies is unlikely caused by mistaking satellites as central galaxies.", "The high value of velocity bias for early central galaxies may\nbe a signal of assembly bias effect, but here the inferred velocity\nbias does not necessarily re\ufb02ect the mutual motion between centralgalaxies and host haloes. With early and late central galaxies in\nthe PCAT or EXT samples residing in haloes of similar mass, we\nmake the assumption that early central galaxies on average arefound in early formed haloes (e.g. Hearin & Watson 2013 ;X u&", "Zheng 2020 ).

In modelling\nthe redshift-space clustering using the HOD model that neglects\nassembly bias effect, such a high halo pairwise velocity dispersion", "would be captured. But it would be interpreted as pairwise velocitybetween central galaxies, causing the inferred central galaxy velocity\nbias to be high. While the above scenario may lead to difference in\nthe clustering amplitude, the difference depends on how strong the\ncorrelation between galaxy properties and halo assembly history and\nit may be buried in the measurement uncertainties if the correlationis not strong.\nSo the assembly bias effect in halo pairwise velocity could offer an", "explanation on the velocity bias constraints. In haloes of \ufb01xed mass,the spatial clustering and the pairwise velocity are correlated (see\nXu & Zheng 2018 ; e.g. their \ufb01g. 12). If the results in early galaxy\nvelocity bias suggest assembly bias effect in halo pairwise velocity,other constraints from the HOD modelling would be re-interpreted.\nFor example, the inferred mass scales for central galaxies would bemodulated by the assembly bias effect and the constraints would not", "re\ufb02ect the true mass scale.\nThere may be other signs of assembly bias in the clustering\nmeasurements. As mentioned in Section 4.2, the quadrupole of\nredshift-space 2PCFs of sSFR-based late galaxies (in both the PCATand EXT samples) appears to be negative on scales below 2 h\n\u22121Mpc\n(Fig. 12), opposite to the expected FoG effect. We \ufb01nd that this\nfeature is not caused by \ufb01bre-collision correction. To further test the\ufb01bre collision, we divide the samples into redshift bins and perform", "clustering measurements. As \ufb01bre collision has a \ufb01xed angular scale,\nthe \ufb01bre-collision effect would show up at different comoving scalesfor the two redshift bins. However, we obtain consistent quadrupole\nmeasurements. The negative quadrupole could result from halo\nexclusion effect for samples dominated by central galaxies, but we donot see such a feature in the early samples. To see whether a simple\nprescription of assembly bias effect can lead to such a feature, we", "measure the quadrupole for the blue central galaxies in the mockgalaxy catalogue constructed by Hearin & Watson ( 2013 ), where\ngalaxy colour is tied to halo formation time. No negative quadrupole\nis found on scales below 2 h\n\u22121Mpc. It remains possible that this\nfeature is related to assembly bias, but the link between galaxy\nproperties and halo assembly variable is not as simple as in theabove model.\nTo summarize, based on the results of analysing the redshift-space", "clustering of the PCAT and EXT samples of early and late galaxies(divided either by SFH or sSFR), we suspect that there are hints\nof galaxy assembly bias effect. Clearly, a more sophisticated model\nincorporating assembly bias with an effective description of galaxyproperties and halo assembly history is needed to further investigate\nthe possibility and put concrete constraints on the assembly bias\neffect. Given the level of uncertainties seen in our constraints(especially on \u03b1", "c), the assembly bias may remain subtle to be\ndetected. Therefore, a variety of observables may be needed to reveal\nthe assembly bias signal, including the projected and redshift-space2PCFs, the lensing measurements, and the count-in-cell statistics\n(e.g. Wang et al. 2019 ).\n6 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\nIn this work, we extend the investigations of galaxy assembly bias\neffect in Lin et al. ( 2016 ) from real space (with projected 2PCFs) to", "redshift (velocity) space (with redshift-space 2PCF multipoles). To\nachieve such a goal, we make an extension to the galaxy sample\nconstruction and divide the sample into early- and late-forminggalaxies (named as early and late galaxies in this work) according\nto either their SFH or their sSFR. With the projected and redshift-\nspace clustering measurements, we carry out HOD modelling toconstrain the galaxy\u2013halo relation to see whether there is any sign of", "assembly bias effect. Our particular interest lies in the velocity bias\nparameters of central galaxies, which is supposed to characterizethe mutual relaxation between central galaxies and their host haloes.\nDifferences in the velocity bias of early and late central galaxies may\nsignal assembly bias effect.\nIn Lin et al. ( 2016 ), the early and late galaxies (called LIN samples\nhere) are constructed to consist of central galaxies and weak lensing", "measurements show that they have consistent mean host halo mass.In this paper, based on the HOD modelling of the w\npmeasurements,\nwe \ufb01nd that both the SFH-based and sSFR-based LIN samples have\nlow satellite fraction (at per cent level). Within the uncertainties, themean masses of central hosting haloes for early and late galaxies\nconstrained in the HOD model broadly agree with each other and\nare consistent with the lensing measurements in Lin et al. ( 2016 ).", "MNRAS 509, 380\u2013394 (2022)Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/509/1/380/6369359 by guest on 11 May 2025", "Galaxy assembly bias in velocity space 393\nTherefore, our results based on wplend support to the \ufb01ndings in Lin\net al.

Therefore, we focus\nour study on the redshift-space clustering with the extended PCAT\nand EXT samples, constructed without the satellite decontaminationprocedure. The PCAT samples are simply the LIN samples before\nperforming the satellite decontamination. The EXT samples extend", "the range of allowed stellar mass of galaxies, leading to a factorof 1.94 and 1.43 times more galaxies in the catalogue.

For example, instead of the central galaxymotion in the frame of host haloes, the velocity bias constrained here\ncaptures the high pairwise velocity dispersion among early-formed\nhaloes (Xu & Zheng 2018 ).

Using a catalogue of local", "galaxies with inferred star formation histories and adopting a BNSM delay time distribution (DTD) model, we investigate thedependence of BNSM rate on an array of galaxy properties. Compared to the intrinsic property distribution of galaxies, that\nof BNSM host galaxies is skewed towards galaxies with redder colour, lower speci\ufb01c star formation rate, higher luminosity,", "and higher stellar mass, re\ufb02ecting the tendency of higher BNSM rates in more massive galaxies. We introduce a formalism toef\ufb01ciently make forecast on using host galaxy properties to constrain DTD models. We \ufb01nd comparable constraints from the\ndependence of BNSM occurrence distribution on galaxy colour, speci\ufb01c star formation rate, and stellar mass, all better than\nthose from dependence on r-band luminosity. The tightest constraints come from using individual star formation histories of host", "galaxies, which reduces the uncertainties on DTD parameters by a factor of three or more. Substantially different DTD modelscan be differentiated with about 10 BNSM detections. To constrain DTD parameters at 10 per cent precision level requires about\none hundred detections, achievable with GW observations on a decade time-scale.\nKey words: gravitational waves \u2013 stars: neutron \u2013 galaxies: star formation \u2013 galaxies: statistics.\n1 INTRODUCTION", "1 INTRODUCTION\nThe dawn of multimessenger astronomy began with the observation\nof a binary neutron star merger (BNSM; Abbott et al. 2017b ).\nOriginating in the galaxy NGC 4993 (Levan et al. 2017 ) located at a\ndistance 41 \u00b13.1 Mpc (Hjorth et al. 2017 ), two neutron stars in orbit\nabout each other merged together, emitting waves not only across the\nelectromagnetic (EM) spectrum but also in spacetime. Gravitational\nwaves (GWs) from this event (GW170817; Abbott et al. 2017a )", "were detected by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration detector network.\nA couple seconds after the GW signal, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst\nMonitor detected a short gamma-ray burst (GRB) (GRB 170817A;\nGoldstein et al. 2017 ). The chirp mass and presence of a short GRB\nindicated that this event was from a BNSM, and an extensive opticalcampaign was launched to search for the EM counterpart. In about\n11 h, the One-Meter Two-Hemispheres Collaboration discovered a", "transient and fading optical source with the Swope Telescope inChile (SSS17a; Coulter et al. 2017 ) coincident with GW170817.\nThe observation of this BNSM event, in many aspects, marked a\ntransition in our knowledge from being purely theoretical to, now,empirical.\nIt has been known since the detection of the orbital decay of a\nbinary pulsar (Hulse & Taylor 1975 ) that these systems are radiating\nGW, implicit according to general relativity (GR). What is not so", "\u22c6E-mail: kevin.mccarthy@utah.eduevident is how these systems form and what happens in the \ufb01nal\nmoments of their merger. It had been proposed that these mergers\nshould be extremely luminous, releasing high energy photons inthe form of short GRBs (Lee & Ramirez-Ruiz 2007 ;B e r g e r 2010 ;\nBerger, Fong & Chornock 2013 ; Fong et al. 2015 ), activating the\nrapid neutron capture process ( r-process; Symbalisty & Schramm\n1982 ; Freiburghaus, Rosswog & Thielemann 1999 ), and forming", "kilonova events (Eichler et al. 1989 ;L i&P a c z y \u00b4nski 1998 ; Metzger\net al. 2010 ;R o b e r t se ta l . 2011 ; Kasen et al. 2017 ). Such predictions\nare con\ufb01rmed by the detection of EM counterparts associated with\nGW170817 (Evans et al. 2017 ; Kilpatrick et al. 2017 ; Murguia-\nBerthier et al. 2017 ;T a n v i re ta l . 2017 ; Hotokezaka, Beniamini &\nPiran 2018 ; Wu & MacFadyen 2019 ). What is not yet well understood\nis whether BNSMs can account for the abundance of r-process", "elements observed in the Milky Way (e.g. Macias & Ramirez-Ruiz\n2018 ) and whether they are the progenitors of all observed short\nGRBs (e.g. Behroozi, Ramirez-Ruiz & Fryer 2014 ). This requires\na deep understanding of the BNSM merger channel, which will in\nturn elucidate how often these types of events occur. Conversely,\nobservational constraints on the BNSM GW event rate will uncoverthe likely distribution of their merger times and thus the important", "physical mechanisms in play (e.g. Kelley et al. 2010 ).\nThe delay time distribution (DTD) of BNSMs is a short hand\ndescription that encapsulates all the physical mechanisms from the\ntime of formation of stellar mass to the moment of the \ufb01nal merger\nevent (e.g. Vigna-G \u00b4omez et al. 2018 ), including the main-sequence\nlifetime of the progenitor stars, their post-main-sequence evolution,\nC/circlecopyrt2020 The Author(s)", "C/circlecopyrt2020 The Author(s)\nPublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical SocietyDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/499/4/5220/5925359 by guest on 11 May 2025", "DTD of BNSM from host galaxy properties 5221\nand various phases of binary evolution (such as supernova explosion\nand the common-envelope phase; Fragos et al. 2019 ). DTD is likely\ndominated by the in-spiral time caused by GW radiation. The delay-\ntime scale for a binary system is predicted by GR as t\u221da4(1\u2212\ne2)7/2, with athe initial semimajor axis and ethe eccentricity of the\nsystem.

If afollows a\nuniform distribution in log-space (i.e. p=1), the DTD then has a\npower-law index n=\u22121( P i r a n 1992 ; Beniamini & Piran 2019 ).\nThis canonical, in-spiral dominated, DTD with n=\u2212 1 is sup-\nported by evolutionary modelling of the BNSM (Dominik et al.\n2012 ; Belczynski et al. 2018 ), as well as the inference of merger", "times in observed Galactic binary neutron star systems (Beniamini&P i r a n 2019 ). However, it is argued that n=\u22121 might not be steep\nenough to produce the observed abundances of r-process elements\n(e.g. Europium) in the Milky Way (C \u02c6ot\u00b4ee ta l . 2017 ; Beniamini\n&P i r a n 2019 ; Simonetti et al. 2019 ), which might require shorter\nmerger times or an improvement in our current understanding of\nturbulent mixing in the early Milky Way (Shen et al. 2015 ; Naiman", "et al. 2018 ). In the case of GW170817, Belczynski et al. ( 2018 )\n\ufb01nd that the canonical DTD has too short merger times to makeGW170817 a typical BNSM event, since NGC 4993 is a galaxy\ndominated by an old stellar population (Blanchard et al. 2017 ). Fong\net al. ( 2017 ) also \ufb01nd that NGC 4993 is atypical in many ways\nto the observed host galaxies of short GRB events, suggesting the\npossibility that GW170817 may not be representative of BNSM\nevents.", "events.\nMore detections of GW events from BNSM are thus needed to\nhave meaningful constraints on the corresponding DTD. Future\nconstraints have been investigated based on distribution of stellarmass of BNSM host galaxies (Safarzadeh & Berger 2019 ), redshift\ndistribution of BNSM events (Safarzadeh et al. 2019a ), and star\nformation history (SFH) of individual host galaxies (Safarzadeh et al.2019b ).

Based on three DTD models, corresponding to fast,canonical, and slow merger scenarios, the host galaxies of BNSM\nevents are likely concentrated in a broad-band across the galaxy\nCMD, ranging from ( M\nr\u22125log h,g\u2212r)=(\u221218.0\u00b11.5, 0.3)\nto (\u221220.5\u00b11.5, 1.0), which can be assigned high priorities for\nsearching for EM counterparts.\nThe ef\ufb01cient forecast formalism introduced in this work is in a\nform of relative entropy of two distributions, which can have wide", "applications in constraining distributions in various astrophysicalsituations. In particular, it can be applied to study DTD of other\ntransient events associated with galaxy SFH, such as short GRBs\n(e.g. Zheng & Ramirez-Ruiz 2007 ; Leibler & Berger 2010 ; Behroozi\net al. 2014 ), supernova Ia (e.g. Aubourg et al. 2008 ; Maoz, Mannucci\n& Brandt 2012 ), and potentially neutron star \u2013 black hole mergers and", "black hole \u2013 black hole mergers (as long as black holes are of stellarorigin to be related to SFH and host galaxies can be identi\ufb01ed).

Therefore,  even though these \nequations  look exactly  the same minus the different  correction  \nfactors,  F SAM accounts  for additional  non-linear  and scale-dependent  \nbias introduced  by the galaxy population  whereas  F HM does not. \nSince our galaxy mock catalogue  was built using an SAM (see \nSection  2.1 ), the naive expectation  is that F SAM should be the correct \nmodel versus using F HM .

Since these elon- \ngations  are al w ays along the LoS, it appears  as if they are al w ays \npointing  back to the observer  and are so denoted  as the Finger-of-God  \n(F oG) effect. The F oG is most often analytically  incorporated  to the \ngalaxy clustering  by either an exponential  distribution  or a Gaussian  \ndistribution,  the Fourier  transform  of which produces  either a Lorentz", "damping  or Gaussian  damping  term (Perci v al & White 2009 ). \nWe model the RSD in tw o w ays. The \ufb01rst has the standard  Kaiser \nterm for large-scale  squashing  and an exponential  distribution  for \nthe small-scale  FoG, which becomes  a Lorentzian  damping  term in \nFourier  space. We refer to this method  for modelling  the RSD as M A \nand is \nM A ( k | \u03b2, \u03c3r,v ) = (1 + \u03b2\u03bc2 ) 2 \n1 + 1 \n2 ( k\u03bc\u03c3 r,v ) 2 (17) \nwhere \u03c3r , v = \u03c3v /[ H ( z ) a ( z )], with \u03c3v being the pairwise  velocity", "dispersion  in [km/s] of the galaxies.  \nThe second method  for modelling  the RSD takes into account  that \nthe standard  Kaiser term is derived  with a curl-free  assumption  about \nthe pairwise  velocity  and that an actual measurement  of the RSD will \ninclude  some contribution  from velocities  that have a curl. Zhang,  \nPan & Zheng ( 2013 ) decomposed  the peculiar  velocity  into three \ncomponents:  an irrotational  component  correlated(uncorrelated)", "with the underlying  density  \ufb01eld, v \u03b4( v S ), and a rotational  component  \nv B . They found that selecting  the cosmological  information  from \nthe irrotational  correlated  velocity  term v \u03b4is equi v alent to applying  \na window  function  ( \u02dc W ) to the \u03b2parameter  in the Kaiser term. \nZheng et al. ( 2013 ) found that with this windowed  \u03b2modi\ufb01cation  \na Gaussian  distribution  for the FoG was best able to reco v er the \nexpected  cosmology.  Thus we have our second model for the RSD", "M B ( k , z| \u03b2, \u03c3r,v , /Delta1\u03b1) = /parenleftbig\n1 + \u03b2 \u02dc W ( k, z) \u03bc2 /parenrightbig2 exp /bracketleftbigg\n\u2212( k\u03bc\u03c3 r,v ) 2 \n2 /bracketrightbigg\n(18) \nwhere \n\u02dc W ( k, z) = 1 \n1 + /Delta1\u03b1( z ) /Delta1 2 ( k, z ) (19) \nwith /Delta1\u03b1( z) being a free parameter  to be determined  by observational  \ndata and the dimensionless  power spectrum  /Delta1 2 ( k , z) = k 3 P lin /(2 \u03c02 ). \nIn spite of the apparent  difference  between  Lorentzian  and Gaus-", "sian modelling  for the FoG, the primary  difference  between  M A \nand M B is having a window  function  or not on \u03b2. In M B , it is \nthe velocity  component  produced  by applying  the window  function  \nthat is Gaussian,  not a Gaussian  applied  to a non-windowed  \u03b2\nthat displays  more non-Gaussian  characteristics.  Peculiar  motions  \non small-scales  that have a superposition  of in-falling  and orbiting  \ngalaxies  are non-Gaussian,  perhaps  being better \ufb01t by a Lorentzian", "pro\ufb01le,  whereas  the coherent  in-falling  galaxies,  which are isolated  \nby applying  the window  function,  are better \ufb01t by a Gaussian  pro\ufb01le.

To account  for this effect, we introduce  two scaling  \nparameters,  parallel  and perpendicular,  to the line of sight, \n\u03b1/bardbl = H f id ( z) r f id \ns ( z d ) \nH ( z) r s ( z d ) , \u03b1\u22a5 = D A ( z) r f id \ns ( z d ) \nD f id \nA ( z) r s ( z d ) , (30)", "s ( z d ) \nD f id \nA ( z) r s ( z d ) , (30) \nwhere H and D A are the Hubble  parameter  and angular  diameter  \ndistance  for the \ufb01ducial  model, and r s is the sound horizon  at the \ndrag epoch, the superscript  \ufb01d indicating  predictions  from the \ufb01ducial  \nmodel. These scaling  terms will distort the parallel  and perpendicular  \ncomponents  of the k -vector:  \u02dc k /bardbl = k /bardbl /\u03b1/bardbl and \u02dc k \u22a5 = k \u22a5 /\u03b1\u22a5 .

Generally  \nspeaking,  a smaller  FoB, means better accuracy  in reco v ering the \ninput cosmological  model. \nThat being said, it is possible  to be accurate  but not precise  and \nthe FoB alone will not tell us that, since a lower FoB can be obtained  \nby not having a mean value closer to the \ufb01ducial  value but by rather", "increasing  \u03c3.

The \nintent here is to smooth  out the short-wavelength  modes at k > \n/Lambda1 through  a convolution  of a window  function  with the density  \n\ufb01eld thereby  decomposing  the \ufb01eld into long- and short-wavelength  \ncontributions  (Baumann  et al. 2012 ), i.e. \n\u03b4( x ) = /integraldisplay", "\u03b4( x ) = /integraldisplay \nd 3 x W /Lambda1 ( x \u2212x /prime ) \u03b4( x /prime ) + \u03b4s \u2261\u03b4l ( x ) + \u03b4s ( x ) , (43) \nthat allow for SPT to more accurately  model the long-wavelength  \nuniverse  with the addition  of counterterms,  additional  terms that \nare added to the action to renormalize  the theory (Goswami  2014 ), \nthat account  for the impact of the short-wavelength  universe  on the \nobservation.  These counterterms  result from a modi\ufb01cation  to the", "Euler and continuity  equation  that includes  an ef fecti ve stress tensor \nthat is sourced  by the short-modes  (Carrasco  et al. 2012 ), are on \nthe order of \u03b7k 2 P lin , and serve to cancel the divergent  terms present  in SPT (Pajer & Zaldarriaga  2013 ). So, in short, EFT attempts  to \nisolate the linear uni verse allo wing for SPT to be used on the long \nwavelengths  with the addition  of quantum  counterterm  corrections  \nfrom the short wavelengths  that cause the model to converge.", "A second modi\ufb01cation  to SPT, which is required  even with the \nEFT modi\ufb01cations,  is performing  an infrared  (IR) resummation  \n(Senatore  & Zaldarriaga  2015 ; Blas et al. 2016 ; Ivanov & Sibiryakov  \n2018 ) that attempts  to model the behaviour  of coupled  modes at short \nwavelengths  that result in longer wavelength  displacements.  This \nentails the decomposition  of the power spectrum  into a \u2018wiggly\u2019  part \nand a \u2018non-wiggly\u2019  part (Ivanov,  Simonovi  \u00b4c & Zaldarriaga  2020 ),", "P lin ( k ) = P nw ( k ) + P w ( k ) , (44) \nwhere the IR resummed  anisotropic  power spectrum  at leading  order \ntakes the following  form: \nP LO ( k ) = P nw ( k ) + e \u2212k 2 /Sigma1 2 tot ( \u03bc) P w ( k ) , (45) \nwhich has the same form as our implementation  of the \u2018de-wiggled\u2019  \npower spectrum  seen in equation  ( 10 ), with \n/Sigma1 2 \ntot = (1 + f \u03bc2 (2 + f )) /Sigma1 2 + f 2 \u03bc2 ( \u03bc2 \u22121) \u03b4/Sigma1 2 , (46) \nwhich we see has the exact same form of our \u2018de-wiggled\u2019  k \u2217model", "(equation  5 ) if we ignore the second \u03b4/Sigma1 term. So, in short, the IR- \nresummation  is intended  to account  for the non-linear  smearing  of the \nBAO signal and is performed  in the same way we de-wiggle  the power \nspectrum  in equation  ( 11 ). One should note that IR-resummation  is \nnot required  in LPT. \nThe state-of-the-art  of PT, termed EFTofLSS  (D\u2019Amico  et al. \n2020 ), is to use SPT with EFT and IR-resummation.

While the RSD on small scales (e.g.\na few to tens of h\u22121Mpc) can further tighten the f\u03c38constraints, galaxy assembly bias, if not", "correctly modelled, may introduce systematic uncertainties. Using a mock galaxy cataloguewith built-in assembly bias, we perform a preliminary study on how assembly bias may\naffect the f\u03c3\n8inference. We \ufb01nd good agreement on scales down to 8\u20139 h\u22121Mpc between\naf\u03c38metric from the redshift-space two-point correlation function with the central-only\nmock catalogue and that with the shuf\ufb02ed catalogue free of assembly bias, implying that f\u03c38", "information can be extracted on such scales even with assembly bias. We then apply the halo\noccupation distribution (HOD) and three subhalo clustering and abundance matching (SCAM)models to model the redshift-space clustering with the mock. Only the SCAM model based\nonV\npeak(used to create the mock) can reproduce the f\u03c38metric, and the other three could not.\nHowever, the f\u03c38metrics determined from central galaxies from all the models are able to", "match the expected one down to 8 h\u22121Mpc. Our results suggest that halo models with no or\nan incorrect assembly bias prescription could still be used to model the RSD down to scales\nof 8h\u22121Mpc to tighten the f\u03c38constraint, with a sample of central galaxies or with a \ufb02exible\nsatellite occupation prescription.\nKey words: galaxies: distances and redshifts \u2013 galaxies: haloes \u2013 galaxies: statistics \u2013\ncosmological parameters \u2013 large-scale structure of Universe.\n1 INTRODUCTION", "1 INTRODUCTION\nConstraining the nature of the accelerated expansion of the Universe\nhas become the major driver of ongoing and forthcoming galaxy\nredshift surveys, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III/IV (SDSS\nIII/IV; Dawson et al. 2013 ;A b o l f a t h ie ta l . 2018 ), Dark Energy\nSpectroscopic Instrument (DESI; DESI Collaboration et al. 2016 ),\nWide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST; Spergel et al.\n2015 ), and Euclid (Laureijs et al. 2011 ).

The", "uncertainties are generally large, limiting the constraining powerof RSDs on models of dark energy and gravity. The intermediate-\nand small-scale redshift-space clustering has high statistical power,\nwhich, if used, can in principle greatly tighten the constraints onthe linear growth rate to a precision at the level of a few per cent\n(e.g. Reid et al. 2014 ;D a w s o ne ta l . 2016 ;Z h a ie ta l . 2019 ).

In modelling galaxyclustering, the halo model (e.g. Cooray & Sheth 2002 ) is widely\nused to connect galaxy distribution to the underlying dark matter\ndistribution that encodes cosmological information. The commonlyadopted frameworks of the galaxy\u2013halo connection include the halo", "occupation distribution (HOD; e.g. Berlind et al. 2003 ) and the\nconditional luminosity function (CLF; e.g. Yang, Mo & van denBosch 2003 ). One implicit assumption in such frameworks is that\nthe statistical properties of galaxies inside haloes only depend on\nhalo mass and not on other halo properties, such as those relatedto the assembly history or environment of haloes. However, it has\nbeen established that in addition to halo mass the clustering of", "haloes has dependencies on halo assembly properties (e.g. Gao,Springel & White 2005 ; Gao & White 2007 ;X u&Z h e n g 2018 ;\nMans\ufb01eld & Kravtsov 2019 ), although the nature of such halo\nassembly bias is still under investigation (e.g. Dalal et al. 2008 ;\nRamakrishnan et al. 2019 ). If in haloes of \ufb01xed mass galaxy\nproperties are affected by halo assembly, we would have galaxy\nassembly bias, which would invalidate the assumption of the mass-", "only dependence in the above models of galaxy\u2013halo connection. If\ngalaxy assembly bias is strong and not accounted for in modellinggalaxy clustering, it would lead to systematic effects in galaxy\u2013halo\nconnection and in cosmological constraints (e.g. Zentner, Hearin &\nvan den Bosch 2014 ). It is necessary to study how galaxy assembly\nbias affects the use of the RSD effect to constrain the linear growth\nrate.\nOur investigation is motivated by the work of McEwen &", "Weinberg ( 2016 ), who study the assembly bias effect on in-\nferring the matter clustering from galaxy clustering and weak-\nlensing observation, using a mock galaxy catalogue (Hearin &Watson 2013 ) with signi\ufb01cant galaxy assembly bias. They \ufb01nd\nthat the standard HOD is able to suf\ufb01ciently model galaxy\u2013galaxy\nand galaxy\u2013matter two-point correlation functions (2PCFs) intonon-linear regime, giving a good description of galaxy\u2013matter\ncross-correlation coef\ufb01cient and accurately recovering the matter", "clustering down to a scale of 2 h\n\u22121Mpc. In other words, an\nintrinsically incorrect model that \ufb01ts the data well can lead to the\ncorrect inference of the matter correlation function down to small\nscales.\nIn parallel to the McEwen & Weinberg ( 2016 ) study, we\ninvestigate how well the HOD and other halo models work in\ninferring the structure growth rate from the RSD effect and down towhat scales the redshift-space clustering measurements can still be", "used to contribute to the constraints, with the existence of galaxy\nassembly bias effect. On large scales, the assembly bias is expectedto have little effect on the inference of f\u03c3\n8. Conceptually, we can\nsee this by considering the linear RSD regime and applying the\nKaiser formula (Kaiser 1987 ). The shape of the galaxy redshift-\nspace 2PCF or power spectrum provides the constraint on f/b,\nwhile the amplitude encodes the information of b\u03c38,w h e r e b", "is the linear galaxy bias. In combination, a constraint on f\u03c38is\nobtained. Assembly bias would change the value of b, thus each of\nthe constraints on f/bandb\u03c38, but not their combination (product),\nwhich is independent of b. However, on intermediate and small\nscales, the situation is not clear, which is what we intend to\ninvestigate.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the\nmock galaxy catalogues and our general methods in the study. In", "Section 3, we provide the results from our analyses. Finally, inSection 4, we give a summary and discuss the implication for RSD\nmeasurements, as well as potential routes for progress.2 METHODOLOGY\n2.1 Mock galaxy catalogues\nWe base our study on a mock galaxy catalogue constructed by\nHearin & Watson ( 2013 ) (hereafter HW13 ) through populating\ngalaxies into the dark matter haloes and subhaloes identi\ufb01ed in theBolshoi N-body simulation\n1(Klypin, Trujillo-Gomez & Primack", "1(Klypin, Trujillo-Gomez & Primack\n2011 ).

(10)\nCentral galaxies are put at the halo centres and random particles\nin haloes are assigned as satellites (see Guo et al. 2015a ). As the\nredshift-space clustering is to be modelled, we also include two\nadditional parameters \u03b1cand\u03b1sto describe the central and satellite", "velocity bias (Guo et al. 2015a ). That is, the central galaxies can\nmove with respect to the halo centres with a velocity dispersion of\n\u03b1ctimes that of the dark matter inside haloes; the velocity dispersion\nof satellites is \u03b1stimes that of the dark matter inside haloes.\nLike the SHAM method (Vale & Ostriker 2004 ; Conroy, Wech-\nsler & Kravtsov 2006 ), the SCAM model makes use of both host", "haloes and subhaloes. It speci\ufb01es the relationship between the meanoccupation number of galaxies and a certain halo/subhalo property,\nand the parameters are constrained through \ufb01tting both the 2PCFs\nand galaxy number density of a galaxy sample (Guo et al. 2016 ). In\nour study, we use three halo/subhalo properties: M\nacc, for a subhalo\nit is the mass at the redshift it ceased to be a distinct halo and for\na distinct halo it is the present mass at z=0;Vacc, similar to Macc,", "but it is for the maximum circular velocity; Vpeak, the peak of the\nmaximum circular velocity over the history of a halo/subhalo.\nFor each SCAM model, central and satellite galaxies occupy\ndistinct haloes and subhaloes, respectively. The step-like functional\nform similar to equation (9) (with halo mass replaced by the\ncorresponding halo/subhalo property) is adopted to describe thecentral (satellite) mean occupation function in terms of the distinct", "halo (subhalo) population. There are two parameters for each mean\noccupation function, the characteristic quantity and transition width\n[the counterparts of M\nminand\u03c3logMin equation (9). That is, we\nhave four parameters to describe the mean occupation functions.The traditional SHAM method can be regarded as a special case of\nthe SCAM model. While SHAM assumes that satellites populate", "subhaloes in the same way as central galaxies populate distincthaloes, the SCAM model allows central and satellite galaxies to be\ndifferent in occupying haloes/subhaloes, which is more \ufb02exible and\nlikely more physical. For more discussions regarding the SHAMand SCAM models and their relative performance in modelling the\nobservational data, see Guo et al. ( 2016 ).\nAs with the HOD model, the two velocity bias parameters are\nalso introduced in each SHAM model to model redshift-space", "clustering. We note that V\npeakis the quantity used in HW13 to\nconstruct the mock galaxy catalogue through the SHAM method.So we expect that the V\npeak-based SCAM modelling result would\nclosely reproduce the /hatwidestf\u03c38curve from the HW13 mock. Among\nthe four halo models, the HOD model does not account for any\ngalaxy assembly bias effect, while any of the SCAM models hasassembly bias built in through the halo assembly bias associated", "with the chosen halo property. Since halo assembly bias varies withhalo properties (e.g. Gao & White 2007 ;X u&Z h e n g 2018 ), it is\ninteresting to see how well the M\nacc-a n d Vacc-based SCAM models\nwork in reproducing the clustering measurements from the Vpeak-\nbased mock catalogue. The halo models we consider here therefore\ncover the cases ranging from zero assembly bias to various kinds of\nassembly bias.\nFor the calculation of the galaxy 2PCFs, we adopt the accurate", "and ef\ufb01cient simulation-based method in Zheng & Guo ( 2016 )u s i n g\npre-compiled tables based on the Bolshoi haloes, binned in eachhalo/subhalo property.

By design, the FOG parts ofthe original and shuf\ufb02ed samples are essentially the same, with the\ntiny difference caused by random motions of central galaxies close\nto each other (Zheng & Guo 2016 ). On large scales, the contours\nof the 2PCF of the shuf\ufb02ed sample appear to be more concentrated,\nbeing lower in amplitude at a \ufb01xed separation. That is, for the\nsamples considered here, assembly bias leads to a more strongly", "clustered galaxy sample and a higher galaxy bias factor.\nThe differences in the projected 2PCFs and redshift-space 2PCF\nmultipoles are shown in Fig. 2. In general, the (absolute) values\nofw\npand\u03be0, 2, 4 on most scales increase as the sample becomes\nmore luminous. For each sample, on large scales, the projected2PCFs from the mock with assembly bias show higher amplitudes,\nindicating a higher galaxy bias factor. The higher bias factor also", "leads to higher (absolute) values of the multipoles. In the cases ofmonopoles \u03be\n0and quadrupoles \u03be2, the difference can be understood\nwith the Kaiser formula (e.g. equations 4 and 5). In the case of\nhexdecapoles \u03be4, the Kaiser formula predicts a value independent\nof galaxy bias (e.g. equation 6). In Fig. 2, we see that this is\napproximately true only on scales above 20 h\u22121Mpc, indicating\nthat the Kaiser formula becomes inaccurate below 20 h\u22121Mpc.", "In Fig. 3, we show the comparison between the /hatwidestf\u03c38curves for\nthe samples with assembly bias included and removed. The black\ncurves are computed using the whole range of redshift-space 2PCFs.First, we notice that even on the largest scales (45 h\n\u22121Mpc) shown\nhere, the value of the estimator /hatwidestf\u03c38lies below the expected f\u03c38\nof the Bolshoi simulation (indicated by the thick dotted line). This\nis a manifestation of the inaccuracy of Kaiser formula on such", "scales, consistent with previous investigations (e.g. Reid & White\n2011 ). Given the construction of the estimator and the application\nscales of the Kaiser formula, we do not expect the /hatwidestf\u03c38curve on\nintermediate and small scales to have the exact value of f\u03c38, either.\nFor a given galaxy sample, it is the whole /hatwidestf\u03c38curve that encodes\nthef\u03c38information, and an RSD model that \ufb01ts the curve wouldlead to constraints of f\u03c38. Here, we use the /hatwidestf\u03c38curves to serve", "our purpose of comparison to study the assembly bias effect. We\ufb01nd that the solid and dashed black curves track each other well on\nscales above 9 h\n\u22121Mpc.2\nIt may suggest that the assembly bias effect would not in\ufb02uence\n/hatwidestf\u03c38down to 9 h\u22121Mpc. However, we note that the /hatwidestf\u03c38curve has a\nsubstantial contribution from the FOG effect, which causes /hatwidestf\u03c38to\ncross zero around 9 h\u22121Mpc. Since the FOG comes from random", "motions of galaxies inside haloes, there is not much cosmological\ninformation to extract. In fact, most of the cosmological information\n(like f\u03c38) is encoded in the halo velocity \ufb01eld, which tracks the\nmatter velocity \ufb01eld and is determined by the structure growth\nrate. It then makes sense to compare the /hatwidestf\u03c38curves determined\nfrom central galaxies (blue solid and dashed curves) whose motionis largely related to the halo velocity \ufb01eld. It is encouraging that", "the two curves closely track each other down to 9 h\n\u22121Mpc, which\nsuggests that the RSD on such scales can still be used to contributeto the f\u03c3\n8constraints even with the existence of assembly bias effect\nas strong as in the HW13 mock.\nIn reality, it is not easy to construct a central-only galaxy sample,\nand it is preferable to have the model separate the contributions of\ncentral and satellite galaxies.

It would be\nuseful to carry out similar analyses with mock catalogues from semi-analytic galaxy formation models and hydrodynamic simulations to\nsee how sensitive our results are to different assembly bias signals.\nGiven that V\npeakand related quantities are found to capture a large\nextent of galaxy assembly bias in hydrodynamic simulations (e.g.", "Chaves-Montero et al. 2016 ; Matthee et al. 2017 ;X u&Z h e n g\n2019 ), we speculate that our results would not have a substantial\nchange. In addition, the assembly bias effect in real data may be\nweaker than that in the HW13 catalogue (e.g. Guo et al. 2016 ;\nLin et al. 2016 ), implying that our results are likely conservative.\nNevertheless, without a full investigation using different galaxy\nformation models, our results, especially the numbers (such as the", "minimum scales), should be taken as a broad estimate.\nMcEwen & Weinberg ( 2016 ) conclude that the matter correlation\nfunction can be accurately recovered down to scales of 4 h\u22121Mpc\nMNRAS 487, 2424\u20132440 (2019)Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/487/2/2424/5512606 by guest on 11 May 2025", "Assembly bias effects on growth rate from RSD 2437\neven without an accurate assembly bias model.

Guo\nAPPENDIX A: MEASURING THE\nVOLUME-A VERAGED 2PCFS\nWhen deriving the counterpart of the f\u03c38estimator in con\ufb01guration\nspace (equation 7), we encounter two terms not present in the one\nfrom power spectrum (Percival & White 2009 ). They are \u00af\u03be(r)a n d\n\u00af\u00af\u03be(r), which are the weighted volume-average of the real-space 2PCF\n\u03be(r) (Hamilton 1992 ), with the weight being one and the square of\nthe pair separation, respectively. That is,\n\u00af\u03be(r)\u22613\nr3/integraldisplayr", "\u00af\u03be(r)\u22613\nr3/integraldisplayr\n0\u03be(r/prime)r/prime2dr/prime(A1)\nand\n\u00af\u00af\u03be(r)\u22615\nr5/integraldisplayr\n0\u03be(r/prime)r/prime4dr/prime. (A2)\nTo obtain such average 2PCFs, one could measure \u03be(r) and compute\nthe above two integrals. However, this would involve the interpola-\ntion between the measurements of \u03be(r) at discrete pair separations.\nIn this work, we directly measure the average 2PCFs by assigning\neach pair the correct weight. For example, with a periodic box, the", "volume-averaged 2PCF \u00af\u03be(r) can be measured through the Peebles &\nHauser ( 1974 ) estimator,\n\u00af\u03be(r)=Nd(<r)\nNr(<r)\u22121, (A3)\nwhere Nd(<r)[Nr(<r)] is the number of data\u2013data (random\u2013\nrandom) pairs with separations smaller than r, with each pair\nweighted by unity. The reason that this gives the expected average\ncan be seen by noting that theoretically\nNd(<r)=/integraldisplayr\n0/bracketleftbig\n1+\u03be(r/prime)/bracketrightbig\n\u00d71\n2N\u00d7n\u00d74\u03c0r/prime2dr/prime(A4)\nand\nNr(<r)=/integraldisplayr\n01", "and\nNr(<r)=/integraldisplayr\n01\n2N\u00d7n\u00d74\u03c0r/prime2dr/prime=1\n2N\u00d7/parenleftbigg\nn\u00d74\n3\u03c0r3/parenrightbigg\n,(A5)\nwith Nandnbeing the total number and number density of objects\nin the simulation box. Substituting equations (A4) and (A5) to\nequation (A3), we obtain equation (A1). Similarly, the average\u00af\u00af\u03be(r)\ncan be measured by assigning each pair in equation (A3) the squareof the pair separation, and the derivation can be seen by multiplying\nr\n/prime2in the integrands of equations (A4) and (A5).", "APPENDIX B: MULTIPOLES FROM\nTRUNCATED REDSHIFT-SPACE 2PCFS\nIn the Kaiser regime (Kaiser 1987 ), the redshift-space 2PCF \u03be(s,\n\u03bc) can be decomposed into contributions from three multipole\nmoments \u03bel(s)(l=0, 2, and 4),\n\u03be(s,\u03bc)=/summationdisplay\nl=0,2,4\u03bel(s)Pl(\u03bc), (B1)\nwhere\n\u03bel(s)=(2l+1)/integraldisplay1\n0\u03be(s,\u03bc)Pl(\u03bc)d\u03bc (B2)\nandPl(\u03bc)i st h e lth order Legendre polynomial.\nThe f\u03c38estimator proposed in this work is based on such\na decomposition (see Percival & White 2009 ).
